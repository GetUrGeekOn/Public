**Opening**

Today is the day that I come down from the sky
This is my birth this is my death I am alive
I’m just a raindrop and I’m cast against the wind 
when I hit the Earth I promise to begin

**Chorus**
There ain’t no disgrace and there sure ain’t no shame in
 F a l l i n g  D o w n
A moment’s a moment and don’t we all know it and how
 a moment might be now
Let it r a i n    down on me 
And lend my body and my soul to the sea
I will change the world at hand; one storm at a time

**End Chorus**
Somewhere a man named Ever in backseat of a car
Stares at neon lights outside a bar
They remind him of his failures and they glow just like his dreams
They flicker as he wanders off to sleep 

**Chorus X 1**
Such a lovely lady in the back of a bar
Stares as a man strums his guitar
His songs are like the teardrops that fall down from her eyes
Some say the teardrops and rain drops; they collide

**Chorus X 1**
